# Evaluation configuration for 2D generated images
#
# Usage:
#   dtt evaluate configs/evaluation/eval_2d.yaml
#   dtt evaluate configs/evaluation/eval_2d.yaml --max-samples 500  # Override

# Required: sources containing images
# Supports BOTH directories and JSON files (DTT dataset format)
# Examples:
#   real_dir: outputs/real_samples                    # Directory with PNG/JPG files
#   real_dir: path/to/json/file.json                  # JSON file with image paths
real_dir: path/to/json/file.json
fake_dir: path/to/generated_samples

# Image dimensions: 2 for 2D images, 3 for 3D volumes
spatial_dims: 2

# Feature extractor: auto, inception, or medicalnet
# - auto: Uses inception for 2D, medicalnet for 3D
# - inception: InceptionV3 pretrained on ImageNet (2D only)
# - medicalnet: 3D-ResNet pretrained on medical images (3D only)
feature_extractor: auto

# Maximum samples to load (null = load all)
max_samples: null

# Batch size for feature extraction
batch_size: 32

# Device for computation
device: cuda

# Whether to compute KID in addition to FID
compute_kid: true

# Path to save results as JSON (null = don't save)
output_path: path/to/results.json

# KID-specific parameters
kid_num_subsets: 100
kid_subset_size: 1000
